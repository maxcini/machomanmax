                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I messed up. I went from ~175 lbs lean and shredded to a fat, lazy 200+ lbs "dad bod."</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><strong>How Did This Happen?</strong></p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I suffered from a chronic chest pain injury that prevented me from doing the majority of lifting exercises. As such, I quit lifting and exercising altogether. I gave up. I ate shit food. I saw my friends less. I had no drive to do anything with my life. I knew I had to change. I should've listened to Martin Luther King Jr.'s advice: </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">"If you can't fly, then run. If you can't run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do, you have to keep moving."</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I've made a lot of mistakes and bad decisions that have led to the degradation of my health, both physically and mentally. And that's ok. It is what it is. There's no time to waste to dwell on the past and make excuses. I now realize that a lot of the qualities I aspire to be: driven, hard-working, and disciplined stem from me frequently training my mind and my body. Living healthy, living "Macho", gives me purpose. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><strong>Moving Forward</strong></p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Mindset switch. I view my current physical state as an opportunity to retransform my body and achieve a new peak physical condition while sharing my journey with you.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Being super lean in the first photo, I was cycling a hundred miles a week on top of a 4-day lifting routine. I was very disciplined and never missed a workout. I loosely tracked my calories and avoided processed foods and sugars. I made sure to eat a well-balanced diet with lots of protein and veggies. Eight hours of sleep was mandatory, and I didn't break my sleep schedule often. I made sure to stretch daily every morning and night. My mind was sharp and unphased.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">As you can see, I was able to get in fairly good shape through a very simple but rigid physical routine. I plan on following most of the same principles again to get back into shape. Below, I will outline the process that I used and is widely accepted as best practice in the fitness industry.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><strong>How We Gonna Get Macho?</strong></p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Let's break it down. I'm going to keep this very simple. First, you have to define what it is that you want and set realistic standards to achieve it. Fuck ten-minute abs. Accept that living healthy is exactly that, living. It's a lifestyle change. It's going to take time and be hard. It's going to require effort. "Anything worth doing is going to be difficult."</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Also, understand that everyone has different reference points. This is you vs you. Fuck what anyone else thinks about you. Never compare yourself to other people. Not at your gym, and not to all the juiced-up Johnnys online.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">"Plan the work, work the plan"</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Now that you're in the right mindset, set long-term and short-term goals. These should have functional metrics that you can test based on results. For example, lift a certain amount of weight, or lose a certain amount of weight. You can test these by lifting the weight or stepping on a scale. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><strong>Sleep</strong></p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Get your 8 hours per night. Mandatory. Nothing else to say. You need to be well-rested to train and perform at your best (at anything), and adequate rest is required for your muscles to grow. Get on a consistent sleep schedule and stick with it. Yep, you're gonna have a bedtime again, get over it. Understand your habits and adjust accordingly. Avoid using your phone before bed, do something else like read a book or stretch. I know some nights can just be restless. Your mind can't stop racing like a horse around a track. At a minimum, close your eyes and relax, even if you can't "fall asleep" I guarantee it will be better than just staying awake. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><strong>Eat</strong></p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Consume nutrient-dense, single-ingredient, fresh foods. Avoid shit from a box or a wrapper. If it can sit on a shelf and not go bad, you probably shouldn't eat it. Eat the same foods every day. I'm talking eggs, chicken, beef, fish, vegetables, fruits, oats, potatoes, rice, greek yogurt, etc. Prioritize 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight to build muscle and stay satiated. As for how much to eat, it all comes down to the basic law of thermodynamics: </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Weight = Calories in - Calories out.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">That's right. Energy balance baby. Eat more to gain weight, eat less to lose weight. It's that simple. [Your maintenance calories] is the amount of energy you need to maintain your physique based on your daily expenditure/activities. Anything more is a surplus, and anything less is a deficit. Remember, your food intake is to supplement your training and help you recover. You can't out-train a bad diet. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">"If you can't track it, you can't manage it"</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I recommend using an app like MyFitnessPal to loosely track your calories. Don't be a bean counter, but log your food to prevent over/undereating. A food scale will become your best friend. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Also, like anything else, understand your habits and adjust. Probably, stop snacking. If you're a late-night binge eater like me, go to bed early. Stop buying shit you overeat on, leave it at the store. "Out of sight, out of mind." If you struggle to gain weight, work more calorie-dense foods like nuts or olive oil into your diet. You know you best, so find what works and stick with it. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><strong>Train</strong></p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Much like your nutrition, your training will depend on what your goal is. A bodybuilder trying to get big wouldn't follow a marathon plan for endurance running, and vice versa. That doesn't mean you have to necessarily pick one, assuming you are not trying to compete at the highest level. It's all about balance. You should exercise based on what you enjoy because that is what you will most likely stick with.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">As far as training plans go, there is plenty of free information online. I would recommend first following an established and proven plan. Once you have experience and hit milestones in your exercise of choice, then you can do your own programming/routine. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For lifting, I think there is a lot of good information including routines on the online [fitness wiki]. Stick to the basics and prioritize the big main lifts (bench, squat, deadlift, press, pull-ups, dips). Practice progressive overload. Try to increase reps or weight every time you step in the gym. If you hit a plateau, don't be afraid to make some changes. As Arnold says, "I feel like I'm cumming with a pump in the gym." OOPs wrong quote, you have to "shock the muscle." </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Also, some form of daily cardio is good for cardiovascular health. Try to walk at least 7,000 steps per day. And prioritize your exercise in your life. Don't make excuses about not having enough time in the day. Shut up and get your workout in.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><strong>Macho Man Max's Goals</strong></p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">What's my plan? Well, I'm currently 200 lbs. I want more muscle and less fat on my frame. A tradeoff... I am going to prioritize getting a bit leaner because it is summer soon. So, my goal is to lose 10 lbs by being in a slight caloric deficit (consuming ~2700 calories/day as opposed to my maintenance at ~3000 calories/day) to lose fat and maintain muscle. Since 1 lb of fat is ~3500 calories, I expect to reach this goal in ~17 weeks, or a little over 4 months. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I will be following a push-pull-legs lifting routine that is 5-6 days per week because I enjoy lifting weights. I will walk a minimum of 7,000 steps a day, and do some form of longer, low-intensity cardio on my rest days, like a short jog or a bike ride.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">And yeah that's pretty much it for now. I'll check in with progress updates paired with more topics to discuss in the future. Stay tuned for my long-term goal, and what it means to be Macho. </p>

                                        If you're going to lead a space frontier, it has to be government; it'll never be private enterprise. Because the space frontier is dangerous, and it's expensive, and it has unquantified risks.
